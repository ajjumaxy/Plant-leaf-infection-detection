# Plant-leaf-infection-detection
This is the source code for our work submitted for review at Inderscience journal (IJSHC). The respository contains the code as well as the data used for the simulations. 

The dataset is taken from PlanVillage dataset from Sharada Mohanty https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset

The different versions of the dataset are present in the raw directory : <br>
  color : Original RGB images <br>
  grayscale : grayscaled version of the raw images <br>
  segmented : RGB images with just the leaf segmented and color  corrected. <br>
